## By: Andree Toledo 18439

## Installation guide

1. Open files
2. With you favorite terminal, access the folder containing the source code and install the dependencies with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main code with `python main.py`

## SCRIPTS
* **Main.py:** is the main program. In this file, they interact directly with the console and the client.

* **client.py:** backend file used for most of the deployment. Here you can find the Client class, which is used to handle all events, some prints, and the main utility of the sleekxmpp library.

* **consts.py:** It just contains a few constants to make the main code look cleaner.
